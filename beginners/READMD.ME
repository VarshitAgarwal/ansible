#Ansible Beginners Track

The configuration management system is intended to make controlling huge quantities of servers simple for the admin and Ops team.
They allow you to control many different systems in an automated way from one central location.While there are many popular configuration
management systems available for Linux systems, such as Chef and Puppet, these are often more complex than many people want or need. 
Ansible is an extraordinary opensource for these alternatives since it has a lot of littler overhead to begin.
